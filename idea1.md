My first idea is to make a glass bead shooting game. On one corner, a hand is holding a glass bead. The angle of it 
follows the position of the cursor. When the mouse click, the glass bead gets released. It bounces around the screen,
hitting the pads at the edge to create sounds. When the mouse click again, it resets.
